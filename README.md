# Introduction
In order to create a database with information on apparel brands, first we collect CBP databases from the official websites of major apparel brands, such as NIKE, Adidas, H & M, and apparel-related shopping sites such as Yahoo and Amazon.

Here,we provide 972,462 images with 416 brands labels.

The structure of the CBP database is shown below.
